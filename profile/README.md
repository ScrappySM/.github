# ScrappySM

Hey! Welcome to the ScrappySM organization! We're a group of developers working on various projects for the game [Scrap Mechanic](https://www.scrapmechanic.com/).

We make mods, tools, and APIs for modding the game, and we're always looking for new contributors to help us out! For example, we have a mod launcher called [CarbonLauncher](https://github.com/ScrappySM/CarbonLauncher) that we're working on and is currently the most advanced mod launcher for Scrap Mechanic! We also make some mods and APIs for modding the game.
